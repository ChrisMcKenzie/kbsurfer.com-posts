So I have just finished a project that requires a connection to a mssql db…I know, why not use .NET? Well no offense to you die hard .NET’ers out there, I just don’t really care for .NET, Sorry!  I originally did this project in python and it worked great! err…well except windows authentication to mssql, still haven’t figured that one out :/, But I digress!

I have recently been playing around a lot with nodejs, so I said to myself why not port this project over to js? I began looking at libraries for mssql written for node and I came across tedious, I slightly giggled when I seen the name, I installed and quickly wrote up a little unit test and much to my surprise I was greeted by success! It was the simplest thing I had ever done! Next I asked is there a web-server framework like tornado for node? A quick google search brought me to express, and in hardly anytime at all I had what I previously wrote in python completely ported over to javascript.

I really must say thank you to all of the developers who worked on all these great projects! You are changing the way the web works. I find it hard to believe that now all a web developer needs to know to create a great web app is JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5.

I would also like to point out a couple other technologies that have been catching my eye more and more. Jade is the successor to haml.js and a fantastic templating engine, and Less which is an amazing tool for making css more dynamic! I also heard through the grapevine (*breaks out into song!) that Oliver Wilkerson is going to be releasing a JadeLessCoffee compiler which I am very excited to try out!
